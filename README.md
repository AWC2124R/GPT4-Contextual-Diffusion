# GPT4-Contextual-Diffusion

This is an implementation of a context-based diffusion with GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, and Mask-RCNN. Utilizing GPT-4's context generation abilities, the diffusion image is procedurally updated with Stable Diffusion's inpaint ability, with Mask-RCNN acting as the mask generator for objects within the diffusion image.
